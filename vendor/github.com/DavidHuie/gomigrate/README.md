# gomigrate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DavidHuie/gomigrate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DavidHuie/gomigrate)

A SQL database migration toolkit in Golang.

## Supported databases

- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- MySQL
- Sqlite3

## Usage

First import the package:

```go
import "github.com/DavidHuie/gomigrate"
```

Given a `database/sql` database connection to a PostgreSQL database, `db`,
and a directory to migration files, create a migrator:

```go
migrator, _ := gomigrate.NewMigrator(db, gomigrate.Postgres{}, "./migrations")
```

You may also specify a specific logger to use, such as logrus:

```go
migrator, _ := gomigrate.NewMigratorWithLogger(db, gomigrate.Postgres{}, "./migrations", logrus.New())
```

To migrate the database, run:

```go
err := migrator.Migrate()
```

To rollback the last migration, run:

```go
err := migrator.Rollback()
```

## Migration files

Migration files need to follow a standard format and must be present
in the same directory. Given "up" and "down" steps for a migration,
create a file for each by following this template:

```
{{ id }}_{{ name }}_{{ "up" or "down" }}.sql
```

For a given migration, the `id` and `name` fields must be the same.
The id field is an integer that corresponds to the order in which
the migration should run relative to the other migrations.

`id` should not be `0` as that value is used for internal validations.

### Example

If I'm trying to add a "users" table to the database, I would create
the following two files:

#### 1_add_users_table_up.sql

```
CREATE TABLE users();
```

#### 1_add_users_table_down.sql
```
DROP TABLE users;
```
